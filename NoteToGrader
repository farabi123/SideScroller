Dear grader, 
I lost a good portion of my code earlier today and I have been trying to restore it since.
the code I have submitted is from earlier stages of the app development when things didn't work properly.
I have run out of time as the deadline is approaching. 
My code had other functionalities earlier including a scrolling screen, an opponent who shoots and the player who shoots.
I also had Bitmaps but I am not able to fully restore them.
Due to lack of time I was unable to implement all the processes again, which is why a lot of it is left in comments. 

Original Instructions to completion (I don't think this runs properly anymore or my emulator is really messing up):
Player moves on to the next level after collecting all the coins in the level
First level: 
Player collects all the coins and then moves to the next level 
Second level: 
Player collects all the coins and then moves to the next level
Third level: 
Player collects coins but as he approaches the fire he is killed. 
The player can be revived up to three times such that the level resets three times, after that the player dies forever. 
 
Thank you.
